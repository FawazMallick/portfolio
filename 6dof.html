    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
      Robossis is a cutting-edge surgical robotics platform specifically designed to improve outcomes in femur fracture surgeries. Traditional procedures for femur fracture realignment often rely heavily on the surgeon's experience and manual dexterity, which can lead to variability in outcomes, especially in complex cases involving multiple fragments or significant soft tissue damage. Robossis addresses these challenges by introducing a robotic system that integrates precision, stability, and feedback mechanisms to assist surgeons during operations.

At the heart of the Robossis system is its 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) architecture, which includes three translational axes (X, Y, Z) and three rotational axes (alpha, beta, gamma). This design provides unparalleled flexibility and precision, enabling the robot to adjust to complex fracture geometries and deliver optimal alignment. The system incorporates a haptic feedback controller, which is critical for maintaining surgical safety. The haptic feedback ensures the surgeon receives real-time sensory input, preventing excessive forces that could damage soft tissues while maintaining control over the robot's powerful capabilities.

Robossis transforms femur fracture surgeries by combining robotics and human expertise. By integrating advanced pathfinding algorithms like the modified A*, surgeons can navigate intricate fracture patterns with confidence. This system improves surgical accuracy, reduces operating times, and minimizes post-operative complications such as improper alignment or tissue damage. With Robossis, surgeons are empowered to achieve outcomes that were previously unattainable through manual methods

    <section class="work">
    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <h3>1. A* Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        To bring the Robossis concept to life, I developed a novel algorithm in MATLAB based on the A* search method, customized for a six-degree-of-freedom robotic system. This algorithm extends traditional A* by incorporating both translational (X, Y, Z) and rotational (alpha, beta, gamma) degrees of freedom, effectively navigating a 6D search space to determine the optimal path for femur alignment. I also implemented Bezier curves to smooth the generated path and ensure realistic and precise movements by the robot during surgery. To provide tactile feedback to the surgeon, I modeled the haptic feedback as a spring-mass-damper system, simulating resistive forces that alert the user to boundaries or excessive motion. These components were then integrated into a complete robotic-assisted surgery framework that enables precise, real-time alignment of femur fractures while preserving soft tissue integrity.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The algorithm was successfully implemented and tested on a simulated model of the robotic system. Realignment of the fractured femur was achieved with a maximal translational deviation of 3.0 mm and a rotational deviation of only 1.5 degrees. These results demonstrate the precision of the modified A* algorithm and the effectiveness of the haptic feedback in guiding the surgical procedure. Below is one of the results images captured during testing:

      <h2>Publication</h2>
      <p>
        The journey to publishing the paper on the modified A* algorithm and its application in the Robossis surgical robot was both challenging and enriching. Collaborating with my peers and mentors, I delved into the intricacies of translating technical advancements into a concise and compelling scientific manuscript. We submitted our work to IEEE IROS, a prestigious robotics conference, where the high standards pushed us to refine our methodology, analysis, and presentation. Although the paper was ultimately not accepted, the experience was invaluable. It enhanced my understanding of academic publishing, taught me how to critically evaluate and communicate research, and highlighted the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges. This process has inspired me to further improve and pursue future publications with greater confidence and clarity. Below is the draft paper we worked on:

      <h2>Poster</h2>
      <p>
        The poster was presented at a Biomedical Engineering (BME) conference held at Rowan University. This conference provided an excellent platform to showcase our work on the Robossis surgical robot and the innovative modified A* algorithm. It allowed us to share our findings with faculty, peers, and industry professionals, sparking insightful discussions and feedback. Presenting at this event not only helped us refine our ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively but also highlighted the broader impact of our work in advancing surgical robotics and improving patient outcomes.
